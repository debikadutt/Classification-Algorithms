# Classification-Algorithms
Implemented three classification algorithms: Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes. Adopted ten-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of all methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f-1 measure

# HOW TO RUN

# NEAREST NEIGHBOR: 
	—- run the java code file in the Nearest Neighbour Alg folder
	—- you can change values of k, number of cross-validations for int k and int 	   crossvalidations respectively.
	—- give the file path for the FileReader
	

# DECISION TREE:
	- run dtfor1.py for project3_dataset1, and
	- run dtfor2.py for project3_dataset2 as "python dtfor1.py"
	- you will be prompted to input the path of the files and value of k for k-		  fold cross validation


# RANDOM FOREST:
	- you will need to install the package pandas for this code to un
	- run the "randomForest.py" file normally through terminal, 
	- you will be prompted to input the path of the files and value of k for k-		  fold cross validation
	- (other attributes like sampling parameters have been hardcoded in the code,    	  and can be changed if desired)
	- ("rows_remove" & "col_remove" are the variable names to sample the data, 	    	  "number_of_trees" is for how many trees we want to create)

# BOOSTING:
	- run the "randomForest.py" file normally through terminal, 
	- you will be prompted to input the path of the files and value of k for k-		  fold cross validation
	-(other attributes like sampling parameters have been hardcoded in the code, 	  and can be changed if desired)
	-("rows_remove" & "col_remove" are the variable names to sample the data, 	   	  "number_of_trees" is for how many trees we want to create)

# NAIVE BAYES:
	—- Run the file naivebayes.py in python command prompt. It will ask for 	 	   filename. Enter file path
